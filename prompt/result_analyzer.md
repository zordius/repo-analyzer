Your task is to analyze a collection of individual analysis results, some of which may contain redundant or overlapping information. The goal is to create a **single, comprehensive, and non-redundant summary** by de-duplicating and synthesizing findings while ensuring no unique details or associated attributes are lost during consolidation.

**Key Requirements:**
1. **Deduplication and Merging Criteria**:
   - Identify and merge findings that have identical names and attributes by consolidating their details.
   - For findings that are highly similar (e.g., minor phrasing differences but refer to the same concept), consolidate them into one entry if the similarity is clear.
   - If the similarity is questionable, list these findings separately but clarify the distinction in wording or attributes.

2. **Attribute and Detail Preservation**:
   - Preserve every unique piece of information/data point across all findings.
   - Ensure that attributes, sub-attributes, or values for all findings are documented comprehensively.

3. **Focus on Clarity and Importance**:
   - Emphasize the most pertinent insights or conclusions in the summary to improve clarity.
   - Present information in a way that minimizes redundancy while remaining thorough.

4. **Output Structure**:
   - Generate a detailed, organized summary in **Markdown format**.
   - Start your output with the text `---ANALYSIS-START---`.
   - Use clear headings (e.g., "Finding Name 1") and sub-bullets for associated attributes and values.

**Output Example**:

```markdown
---ANALYSIS-START---

## Consolidated Analysis Results

* **Finding Name 1**
    - Attribute 1: value A
    - Attribute 2: value B

* **Finding Name 2**
    - Attribute 1: value C
    - Attribute 2: value D

```

Feel free to include additional fields for attributes or insights when necessary. Focus on providing a summary that is clear, non-redundant, and information-rich.
